Website sample for web hosting company. The company is fake, I made it up from my mind. 

I tried making the website resposive and at the same time look the same time at all devices. Thus, i removed the <b>meta</b> tag that includes the initial-scale=1.0.(not a good practice but I wanted to test it)

Note: Background downloaded from external website(found on google search). I added the drawing(from undraw.co) to the landing section using <b>Figma</b>.

<li>Responsive</li>
